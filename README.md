# Kanade (かなで)

A music player that lets you play songs from YouTube using your Spotify playlists.

**Why Kanade?**

Kanade (奏で) comes from the Japanese word *kanaderu*, meaning “to play music” or “perform a melody.” The name evokes music flowing and coming together, like notes forming a song. It’s simple, poetic, and perfectly reflects the joy of listening to and creating music.
And also because Kanade is also one of my favorite characters from my favorite anime *Hibike! Euphonium*.  :P

**My Motivation for creating this (or atleast trying to create this) (whichever holds true in the future)**

I love listening to music while I work. It keeps me focused and makes everything feel a little more alive.
Right now, I’m in my final year of engineering, and my student discount is about to run out. I really don’t feel like paying for both Spotify and YouTube Music every month once that happens.

Maybe that sounds petty, and yeah, maybe it is. But I’m building this for myself.
If I can end up with a music player I actually enjoy using, and learn something along the way, that’s a win in my book. :)
