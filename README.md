# Kanade (かなで)

A music player that lets you play songs from YouTube using your Spotify playlists.

**Why Kanade?**

Kanade (奏で) comes from the Japanese word *kanaderu*, meaning “to play music” or “perform a melody.” The name evokes music flowing and coming together, like notes forming a song. It’s simple, poetic, and perfectly reflects the joy of listening to and creating music.
And also because Kanade is also one of my favorite characters from my favorite anime *Hibike! Euphonium*. :p
